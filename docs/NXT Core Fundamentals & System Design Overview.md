### Scale of Data vs. Scale of Operations
Typically, **the product catalog is much smaller than the user base**, so even a Long is likely to provide a vast range of unique values.


> **ID Generation Strategy** 
> In our microservice architecture, we favor using 64-bit Long values as unique identifiers for **products**. This choice leverages the efficiency of compact numeric IDs for storage and indexing, and when paired with a distributed ID generator (such as a Snowflake-like algorithm), it scales well across multiple services without the need for centralized coordinator.
> This approach is in line with the principles described in Designing Data-Intensive Applications (DDIA), which advocates for balancing performance, scalability and maintainability.


> **ID Strategy & Public API Considerations**
> Internally, we use 64-bit Long IDs for efficient storage, indexing and query performance in our distributed system. 
> For external public APIs, exposing raw Long IDs can lead to enumeration risks. To mitigate this:
> - UUIDs can be mapped to Longs for external representation.
> - Hashing (Hashids) offers a compact, reversible transformation.
> - Encryption (AES) ensures full obfuscation if security is critical.

> **API Design**
> - Consistent:  Consistent naming structure convention and structure
> - Stateless: Each API request has all the information needed to process it.
> - Documentation: 
> 	- Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for each endpoint
> 	- Detailing requests and response formats
> 	- Possible status codes
> - Error Handling: 
> 	- Implement standardized error responses to inform clients of issues effectively.



> **UI Design Approach: Minimalistic**
> - Focus of Products:
> 	- Ensure that our website design highlights the clothing items prominently, minimizing distractions.
>
> - Clean Asthetics:
> 	- Use ample white space, simple typography, and high quality images to create an elegant and user friendly interface.
> 
> - Intuitive Naviation:
> 	- Design a straightforward navigation system that allows users to find products effortlessly.
> 	
> - Inpiration:
> 	 - Collect ideas from other minimalist e-commerce website designs.



> **User Retention Strategies**
> - Consistent Brand Identity:
> 	- Develop a cohesive brand presence across all platforms to build trust and recognition.
> 
> - Personalized Communication:
> 	- Engage customers with tailored emails and product recommendations based on their preferences.
> 	
> - Loyalty Programs: 
> 	- Implement reward systems to incentivize repeat purchases and foster customer loyalty.
> - Diverse Payment and Delivery Options:
> 	 - Offer various payment methods and flexible delivery options to enhance the shopping the shopping experience.
> - Maintain open line of communication through media, chatbots, and customer service to address inquiries promptly.
> - Use data analytics to provide a customized shopping journey for each user.
> - Efficient Management Processes: Optimize your e-commerce operations to ensure a seamless user experience. 
> - Competitive Pricing Strategy 
> 	- Affordable Designer Fashion :
> 		- Position my platform as a go-to destination for designer clothes at lower prices by reducing marketing and branding expenses.
> 	- Value proposition: 
> 		- Clearly communicate the value of offering high quality designer items at accessible prices to attract a broad user base.


> **Choice of DB for persistence**
> PostgreSQL.
> Why? 
> Better concurrency 
> Extensibility 
> Advanced features
> Proven scalability under load


> Scaling for a million users
> "If I am aiming for scaling it for millions of concurrent users, start small, it's important to invest in both proper resource allocation (especially cloud resources) and distributed testing to achieve accurate results."
